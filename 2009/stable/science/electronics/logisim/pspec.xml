                * Version bump
                - When drawing diagonally while adding wires, an "L" shape is formed, so two wires are added instead of just one.
                - When zooming far out, the grid becomes dense and very dark.
                - On some platforms, the canvas would gray out when a component was selected for addition, and it would not clear except for the component's location until the component was inserted.
                - In zooming in or out, the scroll bars were not recomputed based on the new zoom distance.
                - In zooming in or out, the location within the canvas would be lost.
                - A new package (com.cburch.logisim.instance) provides an API that dramatically simplifies the development of JAR libraries. The built-in Arithmetic, Plexers, Memory, and I/O libraries have been refactored to use it.
                - Added the capacity to export PNG and JPEG files in addition to GIFs. The menu option Export As GIF... is renamed to Export Image
                - When a circuit is removed from the project while a tool for adding subcircuits is selected, a different tool is selected.
                - Removed unneeded patch. (macos.patch)
