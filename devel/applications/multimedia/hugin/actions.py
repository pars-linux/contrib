# to get the same tarball checkout the svn revision 3197. There is a rumour
# that revision 3098 will be released as 0.7.0 but since it is not released
# and it is not tagged, we are now going for latest a.k.a. rev 3197
#
# svn co -r3197 https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/hugin/hugin/trunk hugin-svn
#
# and make a source tarball with
#
# cmake .
# make package_source
