            <Date>2009-05-29</Date>
            <Version>0.9.11</Version>
            <Comment>Version bump :
             * Speech Bubbles - during your turn, have your hedgehog express himself.  In chat, use "regular speech"  'thought bubbles'  -action bubbles-  with the quote marks completely surrounding the entire typed text.  You can also use /hsa /hta /hya to fire off a bubble at the moment of your attack.
             * New graves and hats. Animated stars in the frontend and a new theme. Add missing graphics and maps.
             * Two new taunts - a /shrug and /juggle -ing.
             * New mobster voice! A remake of the default voice set. New theme music.
             * New game modes. Karma, any injury you caused (not including drowning) is dealt to you too, unless invulnerable.  Vampirism, where you feed off damage you deal, gaining 80% of it.  Artillery, where your hog can not move about.
             * Options to control mine quantity and timer.  Those are made use of in a Minefield scheme/weapon set as one of the default sets.
             * The sniper rifle demonstrated in previous news post.
             * Various fixes such as: prevent desync when a player quits, fix a crash at end of game in reduced quality, bug in synching changes to map and scheme in room, fix bug in disconnection from server, hedgehogs keep hats while jumping, bug in rope/parachute when drowning with active girder/teleport, bug in rope that on rare occasion deleted it on firing.

            <Comment>Version bump :
             * Many many more terrain generation options, maps can be huge, very small, caverns, caves, stepping stones, etc.
             * To accompany these new terrain generation options there are new themes and musical tracks
             * On top of this there are a ton of brand new preset maps, have your hogs fight on city scapes and lazy old men in hammocks!
             * Lots of new hats (total of 79 now!) and to add to the hats, some new voice work
             * A new type of weapon called a utility has been added, these weapons drop in utiltiy crates and boost your hedgehogs abilities, low gravity, laser sight, extra time, extra damage, forcefield
             * Alongside weaponsets we now have "scheme sets", this means you can save gameplay options into a scheme for later use. We've also added a whole load more options for you to use in your schemes, you can add borders to any map, disable mines, enable low gravity, make all hogs invincible, and more.
             * The server has been given a major upgrade, you can now reserve your name with your hedgewars.org account. At the moment there are no stats in game, but we may already begin tracking them to display them later, so remember to log in! We are also integrating the game with the website.
             * A new Despeckling gameplay feature removes stray pixels from the terrain after fires/big explosions
             * Graphics updates, language updates, music and sound updates across the board
             * Demos can now be played without the frontend
             * Weapons and hogs can now bounce off of the water if they hit it at the right speed/angle.. this can be used in a very interesting way with the rope ;)
             * Hedgewars can now generate your team for you if you're feeling lazy, it also generates random teams for "quick play" mode, and even uses appropriate hats. I.e. it will generate a ninja team, with ninja names/hats!
             * Changed girder functionality completely to make it a much more interesting and fun weapon!
             * Many more fixes and feature.
